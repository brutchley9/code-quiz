# Code Quiz

For this challenge, I will be creating my own coding quiz for self reference, in order to stay fresh on fundamentals in HTML/CSS/JS. In order to do this, I will make a webpage that renders a series of questions activated by a start button, a 60 second timer, and a name entry field to save my score.
